This jQuery plugin takes advantage of Google Maps API version 3 to create an easy to implement store locator. No 
back-end programming is required, you just need to feed it KML, XML, or JSON data with all the location information. 
How you create the data file is up to you. I originally created this for a company that didn’t have many locations, so I 
just used a static XML file. You will need to geocode your locations beforehand or use a geocoding API service if
you want to try to do it on the fly. The reason for this is that all free geocoding APIs have strict limits that would
easily be exceeded. In the end, you're much better off storing the coordinates versus having to look them up for each
location on each request.

A note on the distance calculation: this plugin currently uses a distance function that I found on the blog of 
[Chris Pietschmann](http://pietschsoft.com/post/2008/02/01/Calculate-Distance-Between-Geocodes-in-C-and-JavaScript.aspx). 
Google Maps API version 3 does include a distance calculation service 
([Google Distance Matrix API](http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/distancematrix/)) but I decided not to use 
it because of the current request limits, which seem somewhat low. For v2 I also tried experimenting with the Directions API to request distances but also found the limits to be too restrictive. So, the distance calculation is “as the crow flies” instead of a 
road distance calculation. However, if you use the inline directions option that does provide the distance that's returned via the directions request.

Last, it’s very important to note that the plugin requires the Handlebars template engine. This separates the markup of the 
infowindows and location list elements so that they can easily be restructured. Handlebars pretty slick, will read 
Mustache templates, and the built-in helpers really come in handy. Depending on what your data source is, 2 of the 
4 total templates will be used (KML vs XML or JSON) and there are options to set the paths of each template if you don’t 
want them in the default location. If you’re developing something for mobile devices the templates can be pre-compiled 
for even faster loading.

## Changelog

### Version 2.0.0

Version 2 is a complete rewrite of the plugin based on the "basic" plugin pattern of the 
[jQuery Boilerplate](http://jqueryboilerplate.com/). The overall file structure has changed, several of the [plugin 
settings](options.md) have changed and all of the CSS is now prefixed to avoid potential collisions. In other words, 
you're not going to be able to simply replace the main plugin file to upgrade to the latest version. I've been working
on this update off and on for the past six months, so a lot has changed. I've also added many new features based on the most common requests I've received. The following list doesn't cover everything that's new but all of the important items to note:

* [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) is now utilized to minify and compile the plugin and CSS. You only need to worry about running this if you're doing extensive modifications or are interested in submitting a pull request.
* Plugin file structure and programming pattern have been reworked to follow the [basic jQuery Boilerplate pattern](https://github.com/jquery-boilerplate/jquery-patterns/blob/master/patterns/jquery.basic.plugin-boilerplate.js)
* Many of the methods are public and can be called as needed
* Google Maps settings are now exposed as a setting. Instead of trying to modify the plugin to make Google Maps settings changes simply use the mapSettings option to override.
* Added inline directions option
* Added multi-group live filtering via regex for quick category, etc. filtering.
* Added option to search locations by name
* Added option to set custom markers by category
* Added option for paginating results
* Added responsive Bootstrap example
* Added region biasing setting to handle region/country select field
* Added coordinates and address (user input) to primary AJAX GET request for better back-end integration
* Added option to check for query string parameters

### Version 1.4.9

More contributions from [Mathieu Boillat](https://github.com/ollea) and [Jimmy Rittenborg](https://github.com/JimmyRittenborg) in addition to a few style updates:

* Store the map object into the jQuery object in order to retrieve it by calling $object.data('map').
* Possibility to add custom variables in locations
* If 'distance' variable is set in location, do not calculate it
* Enabling the new Google Maps [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/basics#VisualRefresh](visual refresh)
* Replaced submit image button image with button tag and CSS3
* Overrode new infowindow Roboto font for consistent style
* Removed icon shadows because they are no longer work in the upcoming version of Google Maps: see [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/basics#VisualRefresh](Changes in the visual refresh section)
* Changed "locname" to "name" for each location in the JSON file to match other location data types and to avoid renaming
* Simplified some parts of the code

### Version 1.4.8

This update is made up of contributions from [Mathieu Boillat](https://github.com/ollea) and [Jimmy Rittenborg](https://github.com/JimmyRittenborg):

* Added the possibility to set the 'storeLimit' option to -1, which means unlimited
* Added the possibility to set the 'distanceAlert' option to -1, which means disable distance alert
* Added little checks to only format 'web' variable when it is not null otherwise javascript would gives an error
* Possibility to add custom variables in locations
* If 'distance' variable is set in location, do not calculate it
* Simplified some parts of the code
* If noForm is true, only simulate the submit when the field is actually in focus

### Version 1.4.7

Added ability to feature locations so that they always show at the top of the location list. To use, set the featuredLocations option to true and add featured="true" to featured locations in your XML or JSON locations data.

### Version 1.4.6

Fixed a bug where infowindows wouldn't open if the map div was changed.

### Version 1.4.5

A minor update that includes the latest versions of jQuery and Handlebars, two new location variables and some clean-up. 

* Added email and country variables for locations
* Updated included Handlebars version to v1.0.0
* Updated jQuery call to v1.10.1
* Some bracket clean-up

### Version 1.4.4

This update includes a bug fix for form re-submissions that was most apparent with the maximum distance example. It also includes a new jsonpCallback setting that was submitted by quayzar.

* Moved markers array declaration up to line 115
* Added a reset function that resets both the locationset and markers array and resets the list click event handler
* Includes quayzar's jsonpCallback callback

### Version 1.4.3

A minor update with some clean up and additional language options.

**Additions:**

* Added several options for messaging so they can be easily translated into other languages
* Added event namespacing
* Added category to location variables

**Fixes:**

* The distance error would only display "miles" in the alert. It will now show miles or kilometers depending on what the lengthUnit option is set to. 

### Version 1.4.2

This is another minor patch with a few important fixes and one addition. The plugin has also been submitted to the official [jQuery plugin registry](http://plugins.jquery.com/), which is finally back online.

**Additions:**

* Added a "loading" option, which displays a loading gif next to the search button if set to true
* Added missing modal window callback functions

**Fixes:**

* The locationset array wasn't being reset on re-submission, which was a more obvious problem when trying to use the maxDistance option. Accidentally removed in 1.4.1.
* When using the fullMapStart option the map wouldn't center and zoom on closest points after form submission
* Using the fullMapStart and maxDistance options together would cause errors
* Wrapped template loading and the rest of the script in separate functions to ensure that the template files are loaded before the rest of the script runs
* Changed all modal window DIVs to use options for full customization. I thought about having a third template for the modal but it seems like overkill.
* Updated the jQuery version in all the example files to 1.9.1 and switched the source to use the Media Temple CDN version because Google is taking too long to update their version. 

Note that if you try to use the minified version of jQuery 1.9.0 the plugin will error out in Internet Explorer due to the bug described in [ticket 13315](http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13315).

### Version 1.4.1

This is a minor patch to switch array declarations to a [faster method](http://jsperf.com/new-array-vs-vs-array), fix line 682 to target with the loc-list setting instead of the div ID, and remove
a duplicate locationset declaration on line 328. 

### Version 1.4

This is a large update that has many updates and improvements. It’s very important to note that the plugin now requires the [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com) template engine. I made this change so that the data that’s displayed in the location list and the infowindows can be easily customized. I also wanted to separate the bulk of the layout additions from the main plugin file. Handlebars pretty slick, will read Mustache templates, and the built-in helpers can really come in handy. Depending on what your data source is, 2 of the 4 total templates will be used (KML vs XML or JSON) and there are options to set the paths of each template if you don’t want them in the default location. If you’re developing something for mobile devices the templates can be pre-compiled for even faster loading. Additionally, I’d also like to note that it probably makes more sense to use KML now as the data source over the other options but I’m definitely leaving XML and JSON support in. XML is still the default datatype but I may switch it to KML in the future.

####New features:####

**Kilometers option**  
This was a no-brainer. You could make the change without too much trouble before but I thought I’d make it easier for the rest of the world.

**Origin marker option**  
If you’d like to show the origin point, the originMarker option should be set to true. The default color is blue but you can also change that with the originpinColor option. I’m actually not positive how many colors Google has available but I know red, green and blue work - I would just try the color you want to see if it works.

**KML support**  
Another obvious add-on. If you’d like to use this plugin with more customized data this would be the method I’d recommend because the templates are simplified to just name and description. So, you could put anything in the descriptions and not have to worry about line by line formatting. This method also allows you to create a map with Google “My Maps” and export the KML for use with this plugin. 

**Better JSONP support and 5 callbacks**  
Thanks to “Blackout” for passing these additions on. It should make working with JSONP easier and the callbacks should be helpful for anyone wanting to hook in add some more advanced customization. 

**ASP.net WebForms support**  
If you’re woking with ASP.net WebForms, including form tags is obviously going to cause some problems. If you’re in this situation simply set the new noForm option to true and make sure the formContainerDiv setting matches your template.

**Maximum distance option**  
You can now easily add a distance dropdown with any options that you’d like. I’ve specifically added a new HTML file as an example. 

**Location limit now supports any number**  
This plugin was previously limited to only display a maximum of 26 locations at one time (based on the English alphabet). You can now set the limit to whatever you’d like and if there are more than 26 it will switch to just show dot markers with numbers in the location list.

**Open with a full map of all locations**  
I had several requests asking how to accomplish this so I’ve added it as an option. There’s a new fullMapStart option that if set to true, will immediately display a map with all locations and the zoom will automatically fit all the markers and center.

**Reciprocal focus**  
“JO” was particularly interested in adding this to the plugin and I finally got around to it. To accomplish reciprocal focus I add an ID to each marker and then add that same ID to each list element in the location list taking advantage of [HTML5’s new data- attributes](http://ejohn.org/blog/html-5-data-attributes). I also added some jQuery to make the location list scroll to the correct position when its marker is clicked on the map. 

**Notes:**

A few option names have changed, so be sure to take note of the changes before updating your files - especially people using JSON data.

I've included a basic [LESS](http://lesscss.org) stylesheet without variables that can be used in place of the main map.css stylesheet. If you want to use it make any changes you want and compile it or include it in your main LESS file.

I’m somewhat concerned about the markers for future versions. Google has deprecated the Image Charts API, which is annoying (they always seem to deprecate the best things), but these should still continue to work for a long time. With that said though, my opinion of the look of Google’s markers is that they’re quite ugly. I was working on adding a new custom markers that could be controlled with CSS via the [Rich Marker utility](http://google-maps-utility-library-v3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/richmarker/examples/richmarker.html) but I was unable to get that to work with the marker animations. I was also looking into using [Nicolas Mollet’s custom marker icons](http://mapicons.nicolasmollet.com), which look very nice compared to Google’s, but that project is apparently under maintenance until further notice. If you have suggestions on this concern I’d be interested in hearing them.

### Version 1.3.3

Forgot to remove one of the UTF-8 encoding lines in the Geocoder function. 

### Version 1.3.2

Only a few special characters were working with the previous fix. Removed special encoding and all seem to be working now.

### Version 1.3.1

Replaced .serialize with .val on line 169 and added the line directly below, which encodes the string in UTF-8. This should solve special character issues with international addresses. 

### Version 1.3

Added directions links to left column location list and HTML5 geolocation API option. Also did a little cleanup.

### Version 1.2

Added JSON compatibility, distance to location list, and an option for a default location. Also updated jQuery calls to the latest version (1.7.2) and removed an unnecessary line in the process form input function.

### Version 1.1.3

Serlialize was targeting any form on the page instead of the specific formID. Thanks to Scott for pointing it out.

### Version 1.1.2

Changed it so that the processing stops if the user input is blank.

### Version 1.1.1

Added a modal window option. Set slideMap to false and modalWindow to true to use it. Also started using the new [jQuery .on() event api](http://blog.jquery.com/2011/11/03/jquery-1-7-released/) - make sure you're using jQuery v1.7+ or this won't work.

### Version 1.0.1

Left a couple of console.logs in my code, which was causing IE to hang.

### Version 1.0

This is my first jQuery plugin and the first time I’ve published anything on Github. Let me know if I can improve something or if I’m making some kind of mistake.
